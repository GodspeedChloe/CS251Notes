Week 1 notes


Computer architecture review

* I/O
	Mouse + keyboard
	files (discs)
	Network
	Monitor
	Cameras
	Internet of Things!
* Memory (RAM)
	Data
	Code
* CPU Core 1
	Instruction Unit
	Functional Units
	Registers
* CPU Core 2
	Instruction Unit
	Functional Units
	Registers
* CPU Core N
	Instruction Unit
	Functional Units
	Registers

Multiple cores required because core speeds have hit limit due to heat
I/O devices communicate to CPU with an Interrupt
	- This is so that the CPU can do stuff in the meantime


EXAMPLE
User Level: Firefox and MP3
Kernel Level: Interrupt handler, trap handler
1. Mouse click sends interrupt to interrupt handler
2. Handler returns interrupt to Firefox
3. Firefox executes then sends trap to trap handler
4. Trap handler returns to MP3


Software vs Hardware

Process:	threads		variables, lists, objects	FILE, Window, Sockets
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hardware:	cores		memory	 			I/O
